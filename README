jsGB: A GameBoy emulator in JavaScript
--------------------------------------

jsGB is an interpretive emulator of the GameBoy, designed to be run from
within a web browser. It is written in JavaScript and has recently been
modernized to use ES modules and features a new user interface.

Current status:

- New UI for loading ROMs and controlling the emulator.
- The emulator can load ROMs provided by the user via the UI.
- CPU: Emulated, including the CB-page opcodes. There are likely to be
  opcodes in the standard lists that are missing, and the "undocumented"
  ops will be missing.
- Graphics: Backgrounds and sprites emulated, windows missing.
- Keypad: Working.
- Timer: Untested.
- Interrupts: VBlank and timer emulated. (LCD STAT needs review)
- Sound: Missing.
- Codebase: Modernized to use ES modules.

Tested browsers:

- Modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
